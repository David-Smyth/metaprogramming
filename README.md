# Metaprogramming
Working through the book 'Metaprogramming Ruby Second Edition' by
Paulo Perrotta

# Major Points in History

## v0 Initialization
First, I tried just using Ruby in a simple folder, but very quickly
it became clear that being able to use Rails testing infrastructure,
along with excellent examples of metaprogramming such as Active
Record, is useful for working through examples and issues from the
book.

Therefore, I threw that initial repository away and started a new
one after doing the following:

```
% rails new metaprogramming
% cd metaprogramming
% vi README.md
% git init .
% git add .
% git commit -a -m "first commit"
% git tag -a 0.0
% git remote add origin https://github.com/David-Smyth/metaprogramming.git
% git push -u origin master
```
